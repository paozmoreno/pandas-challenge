With males making up 84.03%, there is a significant discrepancy in the gender distribution of Heroes of Pymoli users.

Because of this, it makes sense to see that males contribute more to the total sales within the game ($1,967.64) than women do ($$361.94). 
However, the average purchase per user is actually slightly higher for women ($4.47) than men ($4.07).
